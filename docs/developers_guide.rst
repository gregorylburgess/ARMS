Chewbacca Design Philosophies:
------------------------------
1. **Make everything parallel!**
	The goal of Chewbacca is to be a high-throughput pipeline, capable of scaling from 1 to 1000 processors.  As such, everything should be as parallel as possible. \
	Run multiple processes! Run mulitple threads! Split files into chunks if you have to!  

2. **Output goes in folders!** (Keep the working directory clean)
	Every Chewbacca command should make an output folder.  If that folder already exists, die.  Don't overwrite results.  If a Command writes files that will be neeed downstream,
	make a new folder for them (separately).  
	* \*_aux folders are for files that we don't need downstream, but someone might want to inspect.
	* .groups files go in a \*_groups directory
	* .samples go in a \*_samples directory


3. **Commands do one thing.**

   To make Chewbacca as useful as possible, keep the work units small.  Do one thing (split, merge, cluster, dereplicate, etc.).  

4. **Programs do all the work.**

   Commands represent high-level operations (cluster, dereplicate, \
   rename).  If you need to move a file, rename a file, parse a file, \
   or whatever, do it within the program class (Program classes inherit from ChewbaccaProgram). side scripts and \
   helpers are encouraged). 

Chewbacca Design Pattern:
-------------------------
**ChewbaccaCommands (classes/ChewbaccaCommand.py)**

ChewbaccaCommands represent high-level commands like "cluster" (Cluster_Command), "partition" (Partition_Command), "dereplicate" (Dereplicate_Command), \
and know which programs are supported (ChewbaccaCommand.supported_programs), but otherwise \
oblivious as to HOW those programs operate (they do not know whether we are clustering CROP or vsearch).

**ChewbaccaPrograms (classes/ChewbaccaPrograms.py)**

ChewbaccaPrograms contain implementation-specific functionality required to complete a ChewbaccaCommand using a particular program. \
For example, Assemble_Program_Pear implements the functionality requried to complete the Assemble_Command using the program Pear.

**ProgramRunner (classes/ProgramRunner.py)**

ProgramRunner objects handle the execution of a command line program (like Pear).  \
The class contains a dictionary of unformatted command line strings, into which arguments are inserted.

**argparse**

Chewbacca uses argparse to take in all command line options.

Chewbacca Naming Conventions:
-----------------------------
* Command classes should end in "_Command". Ex, assemble or cluster.
* Program classes should end in "<Command_Name>_Program_<X>", where:
	 <Command_Name> is the name of the Command your program implements (conceptually, not programatically), and
	<X> is the sub program name you're using (mothur, Qiime, PEAR, etc), or 'Chewbacca' if you're using a custom script.


Adding New Programs:
--------------------

::

   TODO: Add example for on how ot add a new program

1. Add your command line invocation to ProgramRunner
	1.1. Add a ProgramRunnerProgram enum.
		This allows users to define paths to the executable.
	1.2. Add the executable path to ProgramRunner.program_paths.
		This provides a default path to the executable.
	1.3. Add a ProgramRunnerCommand enum.
		This exposes your command to the world.
	1.4. Add your command string to the ProgramRunner.commandTemplates dictionary
		This makes your command actually do something.
2. Add a parser for your command.
	Add a subparser to the argparse object, and fill in the variables and help messages you'll expose to users.
		NOTE: Make sure you include a -p 'program' flag for your parser if you have more than one program for that command
3. Create a Command class.
	Copy one of the other Command classes and rename it with your new command!
4. Create a Program class
	Create a program class and fill in implementation details (this is where your custom code goes).
	The classes/Helpers module provides some useful functions for selecting, moving, and creating files and folders.
	NOTE: If you create a multiprocessing.pool object, make sure you call classes/Helpers.cleanup_pool() on it.
5. Add your new Program Class to your Command class.
	Add your Program class to the list of supported programs.
	Choose a default Program for your Command (probably your new Program Class).
6. Test it!
	Run chewbacca.py with your command name and see how it goes!  Diagnose errors as appropriate.
