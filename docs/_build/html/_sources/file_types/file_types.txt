File Types
==========
Chewbacca uses several common filetypes throughout its functions.
Getting acquainted with these filetypes will save you time and a lot of headaches.

Fasta Files
-----------
**common extensions: .fa, .fasta, .FASTA**

Fasta files are commonly used in Biological sciences to store data and metadat about genetic sequences.

FastQ Files
-----------
**extensions: .fq, .fastq, .FASTQ**

FastQ files are very simmiliar to fasta files, but include quality scores for the integrity of the genetic sequences.

Groups Files
------------
**extensions: .groups**

Groups files are used by Chewbacca to keep track of groups or clusters of related sequences.
A Groups file consists of one or more lines in the following format:

  *GROUPNAME <tab> SequenceName <space> SequenceName space* ...

As an example:

| Rodent_gutID111	Rodent_gutID111 Rodent_gutID112 Rodent_gutID113
| Rodent_noseID115	Rodent_stomachID115 Rodent_gutID117
| Rodent_gutID119	Rodent_gutID119

*Notes:*

1. The GROUPNAME for a group/cluster will likely be the name of a sample within that group/cluster.
	This means that one sequence name will likely appear twice on a line (once as a GROUPNAME, and once as a SequenceName).
	This is not an error, but the intended behavior.

2. See the "naming conventions" section for more info on chewbacca sequence naming standards.

Samples Files
-------------
**extensions: .samples**

Samples files are used by Chewbacca to map sequences to the the sample name that they belong to.
A Samples file consists of one or more lines in the following format:

  *SequenceName <tab> SampleName*

As an example:

|  Rodent_gutID111	GUT_SAMPLE_21
|  Rodent_gutID112 GUT_SAMPLE_21
|  Rodent_gutID113 GUT_SAMPLE_22
|  Rodent_noseID115	NOSE_SAMPLE_1
|  Rodent_stomachID115	STOMACH_SAMPLE_2

Barcodes Files
--------------
**extensions: .barcodes, .txt**


Adapters files
--------------
**extensions: .adapters, .txt**
