class Rename_Command(ChewbaccaCommand):
    """
    Renames sequences in a file with their sampleID and a serial ID#.  Useful for simplifying complex naming systems \
    into \
    human-readable sequence names.  In order to ensure the correct sample names are preserved, it is reccomended that \
    this command be run immediately after the :ref:`Demux Command`.

    **Inputs**:
        * A single fasta/fastq file or a directory containing multiple fasta/fastq files.

    **Outputs**:
        * _renamed.<ext> file - A <fasta/fastq> file with the renamed sequences.
        * .samples file - A :ref:`.samples`.
        * .mapping file - A :ref:`.mapping`.

    **Notes**:
        * In order for the .samples file to correctly list the sample name of the sequences in a file, this command \
            should be run immediately after the Demux Command.
        * The *--clip* parameter tells Chewbacca that trailing _<offset numebr> (from the demuxing command) should not  \
            be considered part of the sample name when naming sequences.  By default this is set to True, and should be fine.  If you notice \
            parts of your sample names getting clipped off in your .samples file, you should explicitly set this \
            parameter to False.
        * Each input file will have a corresponding .samples, .mapping, and _renamed file.
        * The .samples file is needed by downstream Chewbacca processes (Building the OTU Table).
        * The .mapping file is purely for user convenience and record-keeping.

    **Example**:
